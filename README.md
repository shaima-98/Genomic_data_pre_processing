This Python script is designed to automate the pre-processing of DNA sequencing data. It takes several command-line arguments, including the path to an Excel file containing information about barcodes and sample names, the directory containing compressed FASTQ files, and an output directory where the processed data will be saved. The script reads the Excel file, processes barcode and sample lists, decompresses and joins FASTQ files, creates blank output files, and transfers the combined FASTQ data to their respective output files. It also generates a priority list and conducts pre-processing steps to prepare the data for quality control (QC) analysis. This script streamlines the initial steps of data preparation for downstream sequencing data analysis workflows.
